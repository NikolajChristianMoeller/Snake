# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The player controls the snake to collect goals and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. Although I am not finished with the functionality where the snake kills itself when eating itself. The game features a responsive grid and tracks the player's score.
